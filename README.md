## Step 4: Merge your pull request

Nicely done! üéâ

You successfully created a pull request. You can now merge your pull request.

### What is a merge? 
A [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) takes the changes from your pull request and brings them into the `main` branch. For more information about merges, see ‚Äú[Merging a pull request](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).‚Äù

As noted in the previous step, you may have seen evidence of a GitHub Action running which automatically progressed your instructions to the next step. You‚Äôll need to wait for it to finish before you can merge your pull request. It will be ready when the merge pull request button is green.
